# BubbleSort
This application takes a user's inputs for an array consisting of ints, which after going through the method BubbleSort(), will return all the values inside the array sorted 
from lowest to highest in terms of value. 


## Examples
We run the code and see the window asking how big we want the array to be. Let's type 5 and hit enter. In the next line, the program prompts us to enter our array. 
Let's put the following; 5, 8, 10, 6, 2 and we will see this as the output.

            Sorted array:
            2
            5
            6
            8
            10
